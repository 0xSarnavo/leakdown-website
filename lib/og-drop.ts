/* The hero's drop, as a still SVG, for the share cards.

   components/hero-drop.tsx draws this shape on a canvas at ~8.5px pitch and
   lib/mark.ts builds the same shape at 9px for the logo and the favicon, where
   69 chunky dots is the point. A share card sits between the two: big enough
   that the logo's dots would read as a logo rather than the hero's halftone, so
   this walks the same geometry at whatever pitch the card asks for.

   It returns a data URI rather than JSX because satori (behind next/og) renders
   an <img> through resvg, and a few hundred nested divs is a slower, worse way
   to say the same thing. Same constants as lib/mark.ts — if the drop's
   proportions ever change there, they change here. */
